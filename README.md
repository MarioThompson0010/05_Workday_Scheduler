 The date gets displayed at the top of the page, just under the heading.

The column on the left shows the time of day. Each row represents a time of day--9 o'clock to 5 o'clock.  To the left is the hour of the day.  Next to that is a space you may type your notes in, or informtion relating to your appointment for that hour.

To the right of the text area is a save button.  This will save changes to your local client computer. You click this save changes icon to save your changes.  You must click the button--you cannot tab over to it and press Enter.

The rows of time are color coded.  The rows that are colored gray are hours that are in the past.  The red background represents the current hour.  Green represents a future hour of the day.

List of technologies used: Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap
